 	static keyword:
 			1> The static keyword in java is used for Memory Management mainly.
 				we can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks & nested class.
 				The static keyword belongs to the class than instance of the class.
 				
 				
 				
 			2> The static variable can be :-
 				a) variable (also known as class variable)
 				b) method (also known as class method)
 				c) block
 				d) nested class
 			
 					we can use 'static' keyword to make static variable, methods, block, nested  class.
 		
 			-> Common xa vanye static banaune. eg: static String college = "FWU";	
 				
 		NOTE[in nepali]
 		 -> static variable per class euta(1) matra banxa.[class ma depend hunxa]
 		 ->instance variable per object create hunxa. [jati object banayeu, teti nai instance variable banxa]
 		 
 	
 		-> object.     handa j j dekhauxa ===> instance ho
 		-> className.  handa j j dekhauxa ===> static ho
 		
 		 
 		Example: 
 		 1) sc.nextInt();  // object(sc) lay call gareko xa, so nextInt()==> instance Method ho
 		 
 		 2)
 		 
 
 

============================================================================================================	
	
	static method:
		1) If we apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.
			
			-> A static method belongs to the class rather than object of a class.
			
			-> A static method can be invoked(call) without the need for creating an instance(object) of a class.
	
			-> static method can access static data members & can change the value of it.


			====================Some Restrictions for static methods====================
			
			1) The static method can not use non-static data members or call non-static method directory.
			
			2) this & super cannot be used in static method.
			
			
============================================================================================================	

	static block:
		-> It is used to initialize the static data member.
		
		-> It is executed before main method at the time of class loading.
